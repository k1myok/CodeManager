在中国，律师从来不是时代潮流的引领者，只是跟随者。

90年代，房地产行业刚刚开始的，中伦的创始人还做着售楼律师、按揭律师、物业律师，奠定了中伦在房地产法律服务的地位；
2001年中国加入世贸后，大量的反倾销反补贴案子养活了一大批律师，而如今这些律师又纷纷转投其他领域；
2004年起，汉坤借助VC/PE行业的风口，从一个不知名小所迅速跻身列强林立的钱伯斯榜单；
2013年，北大的一个90后妹子和80后师兄一起创办了如是娱乐法，并迅速在娱乐行业法律服务方面站稳脚跟，而在他们之前，有很多律师早已开始研究娱乐法，但却默默无闻；
2014年，在《反垄断法》颁布7年后，反垄断执法全面开花高歌猛进，各大律所疯抢反垄断律师；
2015年，方达的合规团队迅速扩张，在内资律所合规业务中一枝独秀；
2000年，新浪赴美上市，VIE架构诞生，2015年，VIE完成历史使命，一波律师靠拆VIE跻身创收千万律师行业。

一切兴衰似乎只关乎“趋势”。

律师只是这一系列趋势中随波飘荡的轻舟，让律师去预测未来五年的走向，无异于盲人摸象。“趋势”是最给力的朋友，也是最强大的敌人。律师能做的，唯有顺应“趋势”而已。

那么，律师要关注哪些趋势呢？

1、技术的趋势

移动互联网，还没等律师开始拥抱，移动互联网已经遭遇了用户上涨的瓶颈；
大数据，打雷打了十几年，什么时候雨会落下来还不知道；
人工智能，AlphaGo赢了几盘棋就是人工智能的春天了吗？

所以，技术的趋势不是律师需要关注的趋势。即使过几年律师用上了大数据搜索引擎，开始用人工智能检索法规案例，跟若干年前律师从纸质办公转到无纸化办公有本质的区别吗？顶多只是工作方式的改变而已。

2、法律的趋势

2008年《劳动合同法》颁布，催生了大量劳动仲裁案件；
《商标法》、《专利法》、《著作权法》提高（或拟提高）法定赔偿上限，可能增加知识产权案件数量；
但也要注意到，像《反垄断法》颁布近十年，滥用市场支配地位的案件也屈指可数，经营者集中申报的法律需求似乎也是昙花一现。

所以，法律制定、修订的趋势值得律师关注，但不一定会有立竿见影的效果。

3、政策的趋势

可能有一部分人是每天要看新闻联播的，什么是中国的趋势，CC.P要做的事情就是趋势。但谁说的话代表CC.P的意志，CC.P每年要出那么多政策，哪些能有效执行，哪些就是说说，要区分这些，我等小民做不到啊。

对律师来说，政策趋势要参考，但也要有区别的参考。

4、行业趋势

中国的部门法就那么多，要找到没有人钻研的空白领域恐怕不容易，想在法律技术上超越其他律师没那么容易。但中国懂行业实践的律师太少，想想腾讯和360的反垄断案子，腾讯为什么是内部法务上阵，因为内部法务比外部律师更懂行业啊。

如果你比别的律师更懂行业，我相信你会比别的律师更能提出符合客户商业目的的方案，这样你对客户来说是利润中心，而不是像其他律师那样是成本中心，换言之，客户会更愿意给你付钱。

所以，律师同行们，建议你们选个新兴产业，好好钻研一下，金矿可能就在这里。比如上文提到的娱乐文化体育产业，越是经济不景气，越是有口红经济现象。当然，在新兴行业投入也是有风险的，例如P2P瞬间由朝阳产业变为人人喊打的行业。

还有人建议从上市公司的盈利趋势判断行业走向，这个方法，慎重吧。有大量上市公司存在的行业，还容得下新律师杀进去吗？

5、钱的趋势

中国目前创新最剧烈的两个领域，我认为一个是互联网，一个是金融。而其中的创新大多不是互联网技术、金融技术的创新，而是商业模式的创新。商业模式的创新意味着什么，意味着创设了新的法律关系或者动摇了原有的法律关系。

我们律师是处理什么的，我们是处理法律关系的亲。所以，有法律关系的变动，就有律师的用武之地。

都说金融的作用是扶持实体经济。我们看到大量的钱流入了互联网行业，而后我们看到了BAT等互联网巨头，以及互联网细分行业的垄断者。

同时我们也看到有大量的钱没有流入实体经济，金融行业的人玩起了自娱自乐的钱生钱游戏，而后我们看到信托、基金、资管等大量创新的金融业务，还有配资、P2P等游走在灰色地带的金融产业，还有非法集资、互助金融等非法或半非法的金融产业。

中国投资渠道的少和不健全，使得有大笔的钱在各个行业间左冲右突，它们冲入房地产就会促使房价飞涨，冲进股市就使股价飞涨，有时它们又冲进大宗商品市场、奢侈品市场或者收藏品市场，它们来的快走的也快。但它们走了后，不一定都是一片狼藉，有时候会让人发现存在价值洼地的行业，有时会催生一些新的行业，这些行业会吸引一些做长线投资的人，而这些人，很可能是律师的客户。

别的不说，早些年美国资本市场市盈率高的时候，大量中国企业搭VIE赴美上市，中国市盈率高的时候，大量企业又拆VIE回国内上市。钱的流向，直接决定了律师的业务方向。

资金是行业和企业的血液，所以关注钱的趋势，对律师开拓业务大有益处。

说了这么多，好像没有直接回答题主的问题。但说的太细了，岂不是很没意思，而且我自己也在摸索。希望十年后，有人在回答类似问题的时候说：遥想2016年，牧心律师还在研究XX，并逐步奠定了其在XX领域的地位。开个玩笑，与诸君共勉！

把一些文中的核心想法抽出来写在新的一篇回答里了：
发达国家人均比中国富裕的原因有哪些？ - Lightwing 的回答

感谢大家的评论，数量太多没法一一回复，抱歉。就补充几点回复在这里吧：

有不少评论者认为；欧洲各国如果没把全球殖民化，就不会在十九世纪超过中国，或者不会像现在这么发达。额，有点无语。

这些“帝国”的殖民地过程确实对这些国家有利，而且肯定对其它被殖民的地方有害。但是这些国家当时的经济发展不依靠对外扩张啊。英国早在帝国时期之前就已经当了世界工厂很长一段时间了。几次工业革命都发生在英国，后来才开始有移民非洲亚洲之类的事。因果关系要反过来，他们是因为经济富裕科技发达才跑去欺负别人。而不是因为去欺负别人才变得富裕（这是很错误危险的想法）。再说，很多欧美国家都没怎么殖民过（譬如瑞典），现在仍然跟英美法一样算是发达国家。如果真要把所有事情都归功到军事成绩上，有点对不起当时的经济学家和科学家等等。


另外，很多人说把这篇当做英语阅读练习之类的。网上有几百亿个英文文章，大家想要练习英语的话推荐各个网站多读一读。多读多看，对学习外语来说还是蛮有效果的。我也是这样锻炼中文的。

昨天用英语写是因为没有多少时间。每一段中文需要起码五倍多的时间才能写出来。所以匆忙之中就用英文了，不好意思。



－－－原文－－－

I read another answer to this question, and wanted to add some my own theories about income disparity in developed countries vs China etc.

---

Firstly, what is the real extent of this disparity? China's per capita income has already reached about $4,000 on average. In some Tier 1 cities (e.g. Shanghai), its probably already above $10,000. However in most “highly” developed regions, the average income is close to $50,000. And yes, if we look at major western cities such as London or New York, the per capita income is easily over $100,000.

On the face of it, it seems there is still a huge gap between China and developed nations, with income levels still being about 10x higher in the west. To be more realistic, we should probably compare the income level with cost of living (since cost of living is also around 3-5x more expensive), but that is a topic for another time which we could ignore for now.

It's important to remember that in the 1980's, China's per-capita income was only $200 or so. During that period, the income levels in Europe and USA were around $20,000. The income disparity at that time was even more extreme, at about 100x...

In other words, Western income levels have doubled or tripled in the last thirty years, but income levels in China have in the same period increased by a factor of 20+. If this trend continues, then China should quite easily catch up with the West after another three to four decades.

---

A lot of people I met in China really do have some very poor understanding of economics (although that's probably true for vast majority of people here in UK as well). I'm not an economics expert by any means, but I do at least understand basic principles enough to see the logical fallacies.

For example, I have heard people say that;


(1)
China is poor because there are too many people. A pot of money/resources gets shared too much, leaving everyone with a much smaller share. There are many variations of this argument, blaming various issues China faces on the population.

Ok, this is totally wrong. First of all, China's population density is actually much lower than most european nations. UK has a population 20x smaller, but a land area which is 50x smaller. Netherlands has a population 80x smaller than China, but land area over 300x smaller. And there are some even more extreme examples such as Singapore. China actually has far more resources per capita than almost every developed nation. For example, China produces 30-40% of the world's food, even though the population is only 18% of the world total. From many angles, we can say that China is still relatively under-populated!

But more importantly, this is not a game where each country gets a fixed quota of economic activity to be divided between it's people. The most important resource by far is still human beings and their output. The more people/workers you have, the more can be produced and created. If you double the population of a region, then you also double the economic output. If anything, having a low population is more of a burden than a boon, because of the administration overhead and other reasons I can't go into.


(2)
Also, there is some idea in China that rich countries are rich because they are somehow taking more out of the world economy than they put in. So they claim more money is flowing into their countries making them richer. I even see arguments that Europe became rich due to exploiting and stealing other countries during the colonial era.

Well, it is true that Europe has a dark history of exploiting other world regions. Some western companies and banks may even still be making profits today based on this paradigm (e.g. the big UK oil/mining corporations and certain banks). However, this has very little impact on the economy as a whole. Trade only forms a small part (less than a quarter) of economic activity in the UK. And trade with non-western countries is worth only around 8% of the economy. And to be honest, this 8% is in deficit, generally causing money to move out of the UK. It is hardly sufficient to explain a 10x + income gap.

Furthermore, this idea that the world economy is a zero sum game is fairly ridiculous. It makes sense to ordinary people because they feel that if they send (out) more money than they receive (in) then they must get poorer while someone else gets richer. However, the real world does not work like that. It reminds me of the situation in medieval Europe where each king tried to control a bigger share of gold and silver. The Spanish crown sort of won that game, but did not achieve any kind of economic dominance in the long run. It is totally useless to view economic growth as any kind of competition.


(3)
Also, there is the idea that China is poor because others somehow got a head start.

This is somewhat true, as it takes time to gradually stimulate economic activity step by step. But we are kidding ourselves if we believe that developing 200 years earlier changes anything in the wider picture. Don't forget the example of Taiwan – which went from being as poor as mainland China in 1950s to being fully developed by the 1980s. It becomes easier and easier for countries to grow rapidly in this day and age, especially by copying and learning form each other. China has done very well, some countries like Korea have done even better. Some countries have not made any progress at all.

The head start of a few hundred years doesn't mean anything when it's now possible to create more economic output in one year than that of an entire century. I'm familiar with this from finance/HFT etc. - an old established company that has been at the top for a decade or more, can be suddenly replaced by a brand new company in the space of just a couple of years, even if that company starts from zero. Some things such as infrastructure do take time to build up (like China's high-speed rail), but the nature of how an economy works is still mostly rooted in mindset.


(4)
Ok, there are also people who feel that relative economic activity of countries is due to exchange rates or something along those lines. e.g. Some people thought that Americans are richer than Chinese because they gets paid $3k per month rather than 3k RMB. This is also an extremely silly and naive way to see things, not even worth addressing.

---

Ultimately, my theory is that economic activity is mainly based on the way people interact with each other. It's mainly about the “speed of transactions” throughout the system. i.e. it doesn't matter at all how much money (or goods/objects) you have in a community, only how frequently people are exchanging them.

Lets use a simple example. We have two communities A and B, of a similar size.


(A) Everybody gets $10,000 to spend. They don't spend very often, perhaps only spending $10,000 per year. So after a month, people still have the same wealth of $10,000 on average, but the annual GDP per capita (or spending per capita or income per capita) is only around $10,000.

Why would you get a situation like A?

People save money too much, and/or they spend money far too slowly. It takes them a whole month to spend their whole income. The “speed” of the economy is extremely slow. “Money” only changes hands 10-20 times per year. Perhaps they are all producing the same/similar things, so they don't have much need to buy each other's services and products.


(B) At the start, everybody gets $10,000 to spend, the same. But they spend this amount every month. After each month, they still only have around $10,000 more or less, so total amount of money is still not increasing. However, their annual economic activity (GDP per capita) is going to be at least $120,000.

Why would you get a situation like B?

People don't save money; what they earn each day gets spent almost immediately. Everyone is making completely different things, so they have high desire to spend to buy each other's stuff. “Money” changes hands hundreds of times per year. Total amount of money in the system is the same, but moves much much faster, hence the higher economic figures.

---

After a while, B becomes an advanced economy, while A falls behind. The gap grows stronger and stronger over time. Even though the starting amount is the same. China is closer to A, while developed countries are quite a lot closer to B.

As you can see, this "speed of money" is mostly rooted in the people's mindset. Things like infrastructure and investment help to create a wider variety of things to buy and sell, but in the end its all about the way people think.

If you add in liquidity (debt) allowing people to always spend money they don't yet have; and add in strong systems for re-distribution of wealth (e.g. high taxes and benefits), then the circulation rate only gets higher. The goal of an efficient economic system is to maximise this “transaction speed”.

Yes, those people who make money and then store it (keep it in banks) are actually hindering economic development. All China needs to do is to make everyone spend all the money they have every day, and things will rapidly grow (and punish people who save money). Of course its not that simple, as all of these industries have to be stimulated and nurtured until they can be sped up. But please don't underestimate the simple (core) truth behind how to make money flow more quickly.

Finally, just wanted to add that to some extent (for a few decades), China was stuck in a mindset of improving GDP per capita via restricting population, trading with the west to bring in money, treating it as a zero-sum game. And building up government savings etc. All of this is actually wrong. For example, Chinese government lent money to other countries, which only helped to improve the liquidity in those countries, making them economically stronger. Of course it helped a lot in early stages, but the only way to gain massive improvements in internal economic activity is to gradually change the mindset of people.

My personal opinion is that Chinese leadership is now transitioning to the correct way of running an economy. It is now also more necessary than ever due to technological changes which mean that raw (manual labour) production is becoming less valuable and stable. China already has a wide variety of mature industries, and the main group needing stimulation now is the consumers within China.

(some people may ask: but surely people still need to produce goods e.g. food to make an economy viable? Yes, however the best way to drive these things is to have them being bought and sold at a much higher speed, and more efficiently)

(also some people may ask; people surely have to save money in order to protect against disasters such as illness or losing employment, as well as buying homes etc. But these are all examples of problems which have been solved by developing economies.Once government encourages high liquidity through various means, these stop being factors stopping people from spending money. Furthermore, expensive items such as houses and healthcare can only get relatively cheaper over time due to technology).

---

I worry that I still haven't fully addressed the original question here. Well, in my interpretation, the person who asked the question is wondering "Why certain professions can earn much more in the West compared to China?" Even though these people are undertaking the exact same job with same amount of complexity and difficulty; they still end up with different income levels. This is really important to address, so here goes:

(The income ratio between different professions more or less stays the same unless there is a technological paradigm shift. And tech shifts tend to occur globally rather than in a specific country. So the income level of a particular profession usually depends on the strength of the local economy as a whole)

Lets take the example of a London taxi driver vs a Shanghai taxi driver. I talked to some people who drive Uber in London, and they can quite easily make $80,000 per year. However, in Shanghai it might be quite difficult for a taxi driver to even make $10,000 per year. Why?

A simple answer would be that the taxi in London costs $2-3 per kilometer, with $10+ starting price. While taxi in Shanghai is around $2 starting price and $0.3 or less per kilometer. A journey from Heathrow airport to my home in costs around $100. Perhaps $150 for a standard taxi. But a journey from Pudong airport to central Shanghai only costs about $15. Hmm, why is this?

Well we could say that oil is more expensive in London (Chinese oil price heavily subsided by Chinese government), or that London taxi drivers have to pay much more fees etc. for right to drive/park in central london as well as very high taxes. And so on.

But the real reason is that people in London are willing to pay this much for a taxi. Not many people in Shanghai would be willing to pay $100 for a similar journey. People have learnt to accept this cost. The tube (underground/metro/tube/subway) is also 15x more expensive than the one in Shanghai, but millions of people per day still pay it! Even the bus is 20x more expensive.

As peoples' incomes increase due to liquidity of the economy, the relative/perceived cost of their time also increases! They would rather spend this money than spend time walking to their house.

London house price (to rent) is also about 10x that in Shanghai. Food prices are around 5x more expensive. Some things such as electronic goods are around the same price; but at the end of the day; any service which clearly consumes someones time is going to become far more expensive than in other countries. Basic laws of supply and demand.

Essentially, even if only one kind of job increases in salary, it gradually feeds into other types of jobs within the same wider economy. At the lowest end, a house-cleaner in London can make $20 per hour ($3000 per month) very easily, but in Shanghai it might only cost $2 per hour ($300 per month). Hmm, dentists in London can get $150 per hour, while in Shanghai its probably more like $10 per hour. A psychiatrist or lawyer may be $300 per hour or even higher.

If people require more services and are willing to spend more on such services, and can buy stuff no matter what the cost is, then things naturally become more expensive until it reaches equilibrium. 

A relatively high-end programmer earns a $5 per hour in Shanghai. But in London, the expected salary is $50+ per hour, often over $100 per hour. People just spend more, and spend it far more quickly. Even those people earning $100 per hour are also spending $100s per day on all kinds of things. I don't know anyone who saves money (except Chinese people), because there is almost no point at all in saving money in a modern economy.

If we in London spend money so easily, then of course the people working in restaurants and shops and transport and all kinds of services will also earn a lot more. That is the appropriate price for them to sell their services. They would be foolish if they sold it cheaper. And of course it is a feedback loop; as things cost more, people need to be paid more. It only stops when the economy is saturated and people can't buy stuff any faster than they already are.

---

The main point is that in China, people aren't spending money as fast as they can, so the economy can easily get stuck at a certain level. A large amount of wealth is continuously sunk by rich people (and even middle class people) into various things like housing and savings. Also, these richest people in China are generally unskilled. For some reason, in Shanghai/China the people with genuine skills tend to make less money than rich people who are exploiting them through employment, which I really can't fathom.

I don't feel like London/Europe has this issue. Although far from perfect wealth distribution, it still managed to escape this trap in various ways. The local market decides what things are worth. But maybe it's another kind of “freedom” culture which encourages people take the risk to do things by themselves rather than do it as work "job" for someone else's benefit?

The goal of an economic policy should be to distribute and circulate money as fast as possible. So if it's not able to achieve that, then it is failing.
